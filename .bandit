# Bandit configuration for AutoRedTeam-Orchestrator
# This is a red team / penetration testing tool, so many security warnings are expected

# Skip checks that are expected in security testing tools:
# B104: hardcoded_bind_all_interfaces - C2 servers bind to 0.0.0.0
# B105: hardcoded_password_string - password testing needs hardcoded passwords
# B106: hardcoded_password_funcarg - password testing needs hardcoded passwords
# B107: hardcoded_password_default - password testing needs hardcoded passwords
# B108: hardcoded_tmp_directory - temporary file operations
# B110: try_except_pass - some exception handling is intentional
# B112: try_except_continue - some exception handling is intentional
# B113: request_without_timeout - some requests intentionally have no timeout
# B310: urllib_urlopen - URL operations are core functionality
# B311: random - non-crypto random is acceptable for IDs/jitter
# B321: ftplib - FTP operations may be needed
# B324: hashlib - MD5/SHA1 used for non-security purposes (IDs, checksums)
# B402: import_paramiko - SSH operations are core functionality
# B403: import_pickle - serialization may be needed
# B404: import_subprocess - subprocess operations are core functionality
# B413: import_pycrypto - encryption is core functionality
# B501: request_with_no_cert_validation - pentest tools need to skip SSL verification
# B507: ssh_no_host_key_verification - pentest tools may need this
# B601: paramiko_calls - SSH operations are core functionality
# B603: subprocess_without_shell_equals_true - subprocess calls are expected
# B604: any_other_function_with_shell_equals_true - shell commands are expected
# B605: start_process_with_a_shell - shell commands are expected
# B607: start_process_with_partial_path - process execution is expected
# B608: hardcoded_sql_expressions - SQL injection testing is core functionality
